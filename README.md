Overview of the Project

This program will prompt the user to: Enter two numbers. Choose an operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. Based on the user's choice, the program will perform the corresponding arithmetic operation and display the result.

Steps to Create the Program:

Import Required Packages:

Import the Scanner class to handle user input. Main Class:

Create a class named SimpleCalculator. Main Method:

In the main method: Instantiate a Scanner object to read input from the console. Prompt the user to enter the first number. Read the first number and store it in a variable. Prompt the user to enter the second number. Read the second number and store it in a variable. Display a menu of operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). Prompt the user to choose an operation. Use a switch-case statement to handle the chosen operation. Perform the selected operation and store the result. Display the result to the user. Error Handling:

Include error handling for division by zero.

conclusion Creating a simple calculator in Java involves understanding basic programming concepts such as input handling, control structures, and arithmetic operations. This project serves as an excellent introduction to Java programming for beginners, reinforcing the following key concepts:

User Input Handling:

Using the Scanner class to read user inputs. Control Structures:

Implementing a switch-case statement to handle different user choices and perform the corresponding arithmetic operations. Basic Arithmetic Operations:

Performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Error Handling:

Managing exceptional cases, such as division by zero, to ensure the program runs smoothly without crashing. By completing this project, you gain practical experience in developing a functional console-based application, enhancing your problem-solving skills and laying a strong foundation for more advanced Java programming projects. This calculator program demonstrates the importance of clear user interaction, robust input validation, and structured program flow in creating user-friendly software applications.
